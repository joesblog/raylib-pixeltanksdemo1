# raylib-pixeltanksdemo1
A demo simmilar to scorched tanks using some pixel logic.

Don't do it this way, use OpenGL's blending functions and render targets. 

It could be argued you need bitmap access to determine where objects are for terrain tracking, if so there are still better methods available that I'll address at some point in the future.

Also this was a quick code bash, It's not the prettiest of code it's just there to illustrate. the project was templated from the raylib-game-template.
